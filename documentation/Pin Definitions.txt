(PIN 12) GPIO-13 UART_RTS (OUTPUT) - (DEFAULT) Goes HIGH on POWERUP, LOW once system is READY
(PIN 8) GPIO-9 (INPUT) - (DEFAULT) ADHOC MODE (3.3V to pin 8) & FACTORY RESET (3.3V to pin 8, 5 x 1sec duration)

GPIO8 ALTERNATIVE FUNCTION
set sys trigger 0x20

(PIN 4) GPIO-8 (INPUT) - HIGH (4 Î¼s latency) will sleep module 

CTS ALTERNATIVE FUNCTION
set sys trigger 2

(PIN 16) UART_CTS (INPUT) - (HIGH/LOW???) use a 3.3-V signal.  Is tied to sensor pin 1 via a resistor divider network.

GPIO4, 5 & 6 ALTERNATIVE FUNCTIONS
set sys iofunc 0x70

(PIN 13) GPIO4 (OUTPUT) - HIGH after the module has associated/authenticated and has an IP address.
(PIN 6) GPIO5 (INPUT) - HIGH to trigger a TCP connection and LOW to disconnect.
(PIN 15) GPIO6 (OUTPUT) - HIGH when the module is connected over TCP and LOW when disconnected.

Roving Networks recommends setting this to 30 since some access points don't respond to probes.
